# Project Name

Shortest Path Finder

## Description

This project allows you to find the shortest path in a graph using two algorithms: AStar and AntColony. It provides additional features such as:

- Creating a default graph
- Creating a graph based on user requirements
- Creating a complete graph
- Selecting the algorithm for traversing the graph
- User-friendly console interface

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/DevSMike/java-antcolony-astar-algorithm.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd shortest-path-finder`
3. Compile the Java source files: `javac *.java`

## Algorithms

The project utilizes two algorithms for finding the shortest path:

1. A* Algorithm: A heuristic search algorithm that guarantees finding the optimal path by considering both the actual cost from the start node and the estimated cost to the goal node.

2. Ant Colony Optimization: An algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It uses artificial ants to explore the graph, leaving pheromone trails that influence subsequent ant movements.


## Development Stack

The project is developed using the following technologies:

- Java 11
